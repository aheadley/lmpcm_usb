Logitech MediaPlay Cordless Mouse USB Linux driver
	by David Oliveira <d.oliveira@prozone.org>


	This driver was released to add support for MediaPlay Mouse multimedia keys.
	Basically, this is a changed version of usbmouse.c by Vojtech Pavlik.


	Installation:

		First of all, you have to compile input core and USB support in your kernel.
		Check this lines on your /lib/modules/your-kernel-version/build/.config file:

		Kernel 2.6:

			CONFIG_INPUT=y
			CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV=y
			CONFIG_INPUT_EVDEV=m

			CONFIG_USB=m
			CONFIG_USB_UHCI_HCD=m			(or similar)
		
		Kernel 2.4:

			CONFIG_INPUT=m
			CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBDEV=m
			CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV=m
			CONFIG_INPUT_EVDEV=m

			CONFIG_USB=m
			CONFIG_USB_UHCI=m			(or similar)

		As you can see, I have allmost support compiled as module but if you prefer
		it can be compiled kernel builtin.

		Check this lines and recompile Linux kernel if required.
		After input and USB support compiled, you can proceed.

		On lmpcm directory:

		# make
		# make install

		Installation script will copy lmpcm_usb.ko (lmpcm_usb.o for kernel 2.4) to
		/lib/modules/your-kernel-version/misc/ and add an entry to your modules.dep file.

		Now, edit /lib/modules/your-kernel-version/modules.dep and remove
		usbhid.ko and usbmouse.ko (hid.o and usbmouse.o for kernel 2.4) lines
                (if not required by any other USB mouse) to prevent loading of any other
		mouse driver first as lmpcm_usb.

		Loading required support:

		Kernel 2.6:

			USB support:

			# modprobe usbcore
			# modprobe uhci-hcd			(or similar)

			Input core support:

			# modprobe evdev

		Kernel 2.4:

			USB support:

			# modprobe usbcore
			# modprobe usb-uhci			(or similar)

			Input core support:

			# modprobe input
			# modprobe mousedev
			# modprobe keybdev
			# modprobe evdev

		At this time, mouse SHOULD NOT work, try it, if working, that's because
		you have hid and usbmouse running on kernel so if not kernel bultin,
		unload modules:

		Kernel 2.6:

			# rmmod usbhid
			# rmmod usbmouse

		Kernel 2.4:

			# rmmod hid
			# rmmod usbmouse


		Loading MediaPlay support:

		# modprobe lmpcm_usb

		Now your mouse should work.

		This modprobe lines can be added to your rc.modules script if you prefer.


	Testing:

		If everything runs as we expected, you have Logitech MediaPlay Mouse driver
		running in your kernel, anyway you can check:

		# dmesg | grep Logitech

		The result should be something like:

		... ...
		input0: Logitech USB Receiver on usb1:3.0
		lmpcm.c: v0.3.2:USB Logitech MediaPlay Cordless Mouse driver
		... ...

		Try multimedia buttons by running this:

		hexdump < /dev/input/eventX		(where X is the number of the event device)

		Press mouse keys!!
		Is it working?? ;)


	Using:

		At this time you have your mouse support up and running, you can try it with gnome
		acme or other software. I tested with mmkc and it works pretty good.


	Bugs/Support, send me a mail.
